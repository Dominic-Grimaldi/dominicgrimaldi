    <div id="about">
        <h2 class="heading">About Me</h2>
            <div class="container">
                <p>
                    I'm a chronic wordsmith obsessed with choosing the right word for the right situation (or button). I've had a passion for storytelling since I was little. I used this passion to complete an advanced English Degree with multiple awards. I've tutored students of all disciplines in all forms of writing, from editing and brainstorming to final drafts. </p>
                <p>
                    After graduating, I worked in tech recycling and as a freelance writer. These roles paid the bills, but didn't excite me. 
                </p>
                <p>I was laid off in March 2024. This gave me the space needed to find a career I had  real interest in. That's when I discovered UX writing, which challenged my creative and logical sides in a way nothing else did. I was hooked, and since then I've pursued mentorship and certification in the field. 
                    I've worked on articles, manuscripts, and papers of all shapes and sizes. I've also designed mockups for several mobile and website apps. 
                </p>
                <h2 class="heading">Interests</h2>
                <p>I enjoy reading, chances are I've devoured a new book every week. Writing comes slowly, but drafting my own novel has been a lifelong dream. </p>
                <p>Books are my favorite way to relax, but any well written movie or show will catch my attention (and maybe tears). </p>
                <p>I'm an amateur tabletop and PC gamer. It's a labor of love, not skill..</p>
